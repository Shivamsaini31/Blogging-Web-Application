Money fuels politics, and the rising influence of dark money and Super PACs raises profound questions about who gets heard. International comparisons suggest public financing, spending caps, and strict donor disclosure laws can reduce corruption and amplifies underfunded voices.

Case in point: Germany limits campaign spending and requires public subsidies linked to small-donor support, while Canada imposes generous donation tax credits. In the U.S., movements like Citizens United have reversed some limits, increasing private influence. Reforms championed by organizations like RepresentUs include:

Donation caps per donor

Full disclosure requirements

Public matching based on small donations to empower grassroots candidates
