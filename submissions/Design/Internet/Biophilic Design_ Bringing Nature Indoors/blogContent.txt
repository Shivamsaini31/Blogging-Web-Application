Biophilic design is the practice of integrating natural elements into built environments to improve well-being, productivity, and creativity. From indoor plants and natural lighting to organic materials and nature-inspired patterns, biophilic elements are becoming staples in modern architecture and interior design. Studies show that exposure to nature, even indirectly, can reduce stress, enhance mood, and boost cognitive function. Workspaces, schools, and hospitals are increasingly adopting biophilic principles to create healthier, more stimulating environments. As urbanization grows and people spend more time indoors, biophilic design offers a way to reconnect with nature and promote holistic well-being through thoughtful design.
