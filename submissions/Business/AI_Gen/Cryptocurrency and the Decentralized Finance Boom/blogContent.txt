Decentralized finance (DeFi), powered by blockchain and cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, is reshaping traditional banking. By removing intermediaries, DeFi platforms enable peer-to-peer lending, borrowing, and trading, often at lower fees and with more accessibility. This innovation is democratizing finance but also raises significant concerns. The lack of regulation opens the door for fraud, scams, and market volatility. Recent crashes have highlighted the need for transparency and consumer protection. Yet, many see DeFi as the next frontier in financial inclusion, especially for unbanked populations. Regulators are cautiously entering the space, and their actions in the coming years will determine whether DeFi becomes a sustainable alternative or a speculative bubble.
