As digital media becomes the primary source of information globally, misinformation has emerged as a major threat to international diplomacy. Political narratives, often distorted through social platforms, can escalate tensions between nations and influence public opinion. Governments are now tasked with not only managing real-world diplomatic channels but also mitigating the impact of false information online. Social media platforms have been both a catalyst and a challenge, allowing global leaders to communicate directly with their citizens while simultaneously being hotbeds for fake news. The 21st century requires a new diplomatic playbookâ€”one that integrates cybersecurity, media literacy, and rapid response teams to prevent conflict triggered by misinformation. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, global diplomacy must evolve to counter the influence of digital distortions on international relations.
