A worrying trend has emerged in several democratic countries: the rise of authoritarian practices under the guise of populism and national security. Leaders in countries like Hungary, India, and Brazil have employed tactics such as media suppression, judicial manipulation, and xenophobic rhetoric to consolidate power. These actions, while often legally justified, erode the fundamental tenets of democracy. The global shift toward authoritarianism is further exacerbated by economic inequality and misinformation, which fuel public dissatisfaction and empower strongman leaders. It's essential for civil society, independent media, and international watchdogs to remain vigilant. Democracies must continuously renew themselves by ensuring transparency, upholding constitutional checks and balances, and protecting minority rights.
