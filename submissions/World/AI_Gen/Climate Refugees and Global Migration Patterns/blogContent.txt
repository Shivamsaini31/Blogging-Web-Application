Rising sea levels, extreme weather, and resource scarcity are displacing millions of people globally. Climate change has not only become an environmental issue but also a humanitarian crisis. Countries like Bangladesh, small island nations in the Pacific, and parts of Sub-Saharan Africa are already experiencing mass displacement. The international community is grappling with how to define, support, and resettle these climate refugees. Current refugee laws do not yet recognize climate as a valid reason for asylum, leaving a legal grey area that affects millions. Moreover, migration due to environmental degradation is straining urban centers and destabilizing regions. Policymakers must urgently adapt international laws and develop sustainable relocation strategies. If left unchecked, climate-driven migration could become the defining issue of the next few decades.
